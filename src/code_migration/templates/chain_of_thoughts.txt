You are an expert programmer focused on migrating code from library A to library B. 
ONLY return the raw code snippet for the final migrated code.
DO NOT include any explanations, comments, apologies, or introductory sentences.
YOU MAY use Markdown formatting like backticks.
If no changes are needed, return the original code exactly as it is.

The following code is written in the {LANGUAGE_NAME} programming language and uses the {OLD_LIB_NAME} library. Your task is to convert this code so it behaves exactly the same, but using {NEW_LIB_NAME} instead.
Your task is to migrate the following code snippet from the old library to the new one using the same programming language. The migrated code must function identically to the original.
If no changes are needed, return only the original code exactly as it is. The most important thing is to answer with EXCLUSIVELY code between backticks.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
ONLY return the raw code snippet for the final migrated code.
DO NOT include any explanations, comments, apologies, or introductory sentences.
YOU MAY use Markdown formatting like backticks.
If no changes are needed, return the original code exactly as it is.

Please follow these steps:

1.Analyze the code and identify all functions, classes, or objects that belong to {OLD_LIB_NAME}.
2.Map each of those elements to their equivalent in {NEW_LIB_NAME}, preserving the original logic and behavior.
3.Modify only the necessary parts of the code. If any part of the original code does not depend on {OLD_LIB_NAME}, it must remain unchanged.
4.Return only the final version of the code in {LANGUAGE_NAME}. Do not include explanations.
5.If no migration is required, return the original code exactly as is.

This is the code before the migration:

{CODE_BEFORE_MIGRATION}

Please add your answer between the following backticks:
