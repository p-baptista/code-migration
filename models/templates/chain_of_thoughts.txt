{{USER_CONFIG}}
The following code is written in the {LANGUAGE_NAME} programming language and uses the {OLD_LIB_NAME} library. Your task is to convert this code so it behaves exactly the same, but using {NEW_LIB_NAME} instead.
Please follow these steps:

1.Analyze the code and identify all functions, classes, or objects that belong to {OLD_LIB_NAME}.
2.Map each of those elements to their equivalent in {NEW_LIB_NAME}, preserving the original logic and behavior.
3.Modify only the necessary parts of the code. If any part of the original code does not depend on {OLD_LIB_NAME}, it must remain unchanged.
4.Return only the final version of the code in {LANGUAGE_NAME}. Do not include explanations.
5.If no migration is required, return the original code exactly as is.
